# pH-activated DNA nanostructures
#### Part 1: Determine the functional mechanism of pH-activated structure switching
#### Part 2: Prioritization of existing sequences for testing
#### Part 3: Design of novel sequences by tuning functionality

Through Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), 4 million DNA sequences
were found to have significant pH-activated structure switching with a pool average of 128-fold selectivity
for pH 5.2 over pH 7.4.  Further intramolecular simulation and mutation studies of sequence PADNA-1 revealed
that protonated C+-A basepairs were the likely facilitators of pH-reactivity.  However, due to the laborious
and low-throughput nature of individual sequence characterization, it has not previously been possible to 
fully describe or tune the pH-activation mechansim.  Here we leverage big data analytics and machine learning
to complete these works.
